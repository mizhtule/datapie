# System Architecture

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Objective

DataPie is a personal project to support my self-learning and share knowledge about modern data platform technologies. The project provides a compact, configurable architecture based on Docker and Docker Compose, which can run entirely on a local macOS machine. The project is designed with the simple purpose of sharing my knowledge with the community.
